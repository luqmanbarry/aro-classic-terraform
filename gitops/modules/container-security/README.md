# OpenShift Container Security

This helm chart deploys the OpenShift Container Security operator. Read the docs to learn more about the capabilities it comes with.

## Inputs

Required inputs are defined in the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file of the helm chart. 

The recommended pattern is to keep all common (defaults) parameters set in the `values.yaml` and overwrite params that change per cluster in the `values.cluster-name.yaml` file.

## Dependencies
